    <h1>Welcome to Our Secure Login System</h1>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates a secure and modern user authentication system using Flask. 
        With proper form validation, hashed password storage, and user session management, this site ensures both functionality and security for all users.
    </p>

    <h2>Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>User Registration with form validation</li>
        <li>Login with secure password handling</li>
        <li>Flash messages for user feedback</li>
        <li>Session management with logout support</li>
        <li>Sticky header and footer UI layout</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
        This simple Flask application serves as a foundation for any larger authentication-based project. It uses:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flask-WTF</strong> for form handling</li>
            <li><strong>Flask-Login</strong> for managing user sessions</li>
            <li><strong>SQLite</strong> for lightweight database needs</li>
            <li><strong>Jinja2 templating</strong> for dynamic HTML pages</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Why Use This App?</h2>
    <p>
        Whether you're building a portfolio site, an internal dashboard, or a full-fledged web application, starting with a solid login/signup system saves time and ensures users' data is protected. 
        You can easily expand this app to include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Password reset via email</li>
        <li>User roles (admin/user)</li>
        <li>Profile pages</li>
        <li>Two-factor authentication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Try It Out!</h2>
    <p>
        If you're new, click "Sign Up" to create an account. Already have one? Click "Login" and test the authentication. 
        After logging in, you'll see a custom dashboard showing your user details.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page is intentionally long to demonstrate a fully scrollable layout. You can use this content to test your sticky header and footer!
