    <h1>Welcome to PillowTalks 👥</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>PillowTalks</strong> is a safe, anonymous chat platform built using Flask where users can talk freely without revealing their identity.
        Whether you're looking for deep conversation, casual chat, or just someone to listen — PillowTalks connects you instantly.
    </p>

    <h2>✨ Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Anonymous 1-on-1 chat system</li>
        <li>Interest-based matchmaking</li>
        <li>Timer-based auto chat session (e.g., 7 mins limit)</li>
        <li>Flask-SocketIO for real-time chat</li>
        <li>User authentication system (login/signup/logout)</li>
        <li>Secure password handling with hashing</li>
        <li>Flash messages and session management</li>
        <li>Dashboard for user access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Once you're logged in, you can enter the anonymous chat system. Based on your selected interests (e.g., movies, travel, tech, etc.), we match you with a like-minded stranger.
        The conversation is private, real-time, and disappears after the session ends.
    </p>

    <h2>🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flask</strong> – lightweight Python web framework</li>
        <li><strong>Flask-SocketIO</strong> – real-time bi-directional communication</li>
        <li><strong>Flask-Login</strong> – user authentication/session handling</li>
        <li><strong>SQLite</strong> – simple and fast database</li>
        <li><strong>WTForms</strong> – form validation and rendering</li>
        <li><strong>Jinja2</strong> – templating for dynamic HTML pages</li>
    </ul>
